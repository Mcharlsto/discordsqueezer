# DiscordSqueezer

A simple GUI for FFMPEG to compress video files down to Discord's file size requirements.

AUR package at [https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/discordsqueezer-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/discordsqueezer-git).
Windows & macOS binaries coming soon.

Built with PyQt5, [ffmpeg-python](https://github.com/kkroening/ffmpeg-python), and a [cursed but very useful C# shim to enable automatic clipboard copying on Windows](https://github.com/rostok/file2clip).
